# BPlus-Tree-LinearHashing
Implemented B+ Tree and Linear Hashing in python

## B+ Tree:
<br> Implemented to handle following queries:
<br> 1. INSERT x (Inserts x into the B+ tree)
<br> 2. FIND x (Output: YES if x exists in the B+ tree, else NO)
<br> 3. COUNT x (Output: No of occurances of x in the B+ tree)
<br> 4. RANGE x y (Output: No of elements in between x and y in B+ tree)


## Linear Hashing:
<br> Implemented insertion and handled duplicate elimination.
